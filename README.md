# Matthew David Wasylko - Software Developer 🌊  
## CodeClan / CodeBase Graduate 🏔️ 

I recently graduated from the 16-week, Professional Software Development course facilitated by CodeClan / CodeBase - Cohort G38!

I'm into Green Tech, Tech for Good & Creative Technologies. In my spare time I enjoy reading about science, usually articles from the NewScientist magazine or just from googling questions I think of - most of the subjects I enjoy have a focus on sustainability. I'm particularly interested in how software can benefit the research in these fields!

🌳  Currently looking for a software developer role to continue my career transition and bring my previous employment skills into my new passion for software engineering  🌳
