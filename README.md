# Matthew David Wasylko - Junior Software Developer 🌊  
## CodeClan / CodeBase 🏔️ 

I'm currently studying on the 16-week, Professional Software Development course facilitated by CodeClan / CodeBase - Cohort G38!

The languages, frameworks and libraries I've learnt so far include Javascript, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, Flask, Jinja, React, ArcGIS and more 

I'm into Green Tech, Tech for Good & Creative Technologies. In my spare time I enjoy reading about science, usually articles from the NewScientist magazine or just from googling questions I think of - most of the subjects I enjoy have a focus on sustainability. I'm particularly interested in how software can benefit the research in these fields!

🌳  Currently looking for a junior developer role to continue my career transition and bring my previous employment skills into my new passion for software engineering  🌳
