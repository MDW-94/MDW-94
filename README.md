I am driven by technology that creates positive impact. My passions include GIS, Tech for Good & Creative Technologies. In my spare time I enjoy reading about science, usually articles from the NewScientist magazine or just from googling questions I think of - most of the subjects I enjoy have a focus on sustainability. I'm particularly interested in how software can benefit the research in these fields</div>
